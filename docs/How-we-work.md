## DRI / Directly Responsible Individual

{: .note }
> Apple coined the term "directly responsible individual" (DRI) to refer to the **one person with whom the buck stopped on any given project**. The idea is that every project is assigned an ***empowered*** DRI who is ultimately held accountable for the success (or failure) of that project.

> https://www.quora.com/How-well-does-Apples-Directly-Responsible-Individual-DRI-model-work-in-practice

Issues, proposed changes, etc should be raised directly with the DRI; **the DRI's decision is final** - however, the DRI must **effectively communicate and document** the reasons, goals, and subsequent lessons for any changes implemented.

### PRINCIPLE: **Every initiative** will have a **DRI**

## Sprint Sovereign

The Sprint Sovereign runs (i.e. is the DRI for) Tapas as well as [Retro ðŸ‘‰](https://github.com/DeloitteDigitalUK/xLab/wiki) and [BacklogðŸ‘‰](https://github.com/DeloitteDigitalUK/xLab/wiki) sessions.

{: .note }
### PRINCIPLE: Sovereign rotates every 2 weeks throughout every member of the team. You're encouraged to volunteer, otherwise a random name will be picked via Slackbot

## Changelog

Changes to ways-of-working (**standup, retro, backlog, toolkit, etc**) are documented in a **[changelog ðŸ‘‰](https://github.com/DeloitteDigitalUK/xLab/releases)**.

This creates a **traceable** flow of logic that explains are current working cadence, ensuring we don't end up repeating things over time.

## Task-tracking, team-tracking, Jira, and Asana

We currently use Jira Cloud for both task-tracking and management-information.
We've previously tried:
* Asana (lacked MI)
* Jira (not helpful on an individual task-management level)

**DRI - BS ER**
