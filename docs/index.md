handbook
====

scope 🪓
---
The handbook is narrow in scope and deep detail. abstracting for current work and projects this should contain sufficient information to answer a hypothetical new-joiner's question:

> during my first week here, what do I need to know to be at the right place at the right time?

nothing more

principles 🎯
------------
-   editable by all
-   the **team's meta-knowledge** in one place
-   an informal, **structured**, **accurate** **snapshot** of **our [methodologies, workflows](How-we-(enable)-work), and current [meeting cadence](Meeting-Cadence)**
-   a **known, single-source** of a narrowly defined set of atemporal (i.e. not project-specific) how we operate
-   the [[changelog and release notes]] summarises changes in our [[ways of working]] - i.e. everything we've learnt and struggled with working in a distributed manner, our iterative approach to overcoming them, and how that's informed our vision of the [[future of work]]

What this is not
----------------

-   a **knowledge-base for everything** we've done
-   information on anything beyond **core team admin**
