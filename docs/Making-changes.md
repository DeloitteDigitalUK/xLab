Team members are **empowered to make or suggest improvements** if they believe it addresses a **[ðŸ‘‰ pain-point](https://github.com/dsrptn/xLab/issues/)**. That's why this wiki is editable by all.

The reason we're documenting this is:

Once someone implements a change they are the [ðŸ‘‰ DRI](https://github.com/DeloitteDigitalUK/xLab/wiki) for that initiative. This means they must:

-   ensure details are **communicated effectively** to the team
-   **document the changes,** the [rationale](https://github.com/dsrptn/xLab/issues/), and [outcomes](https://github.com/dsrptn/xLab/releases/)

This ensures

-   we have an **accessible**, **asynchronous-friendly** **reference**
-   we avoid **unknowingly reverting to past changes,**
-   we don't **disadvantage those away**
