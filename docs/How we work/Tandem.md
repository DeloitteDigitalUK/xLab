## Tandem

Amongst the many [issues of working in a fully distributed team ðŸ‘‰ ](https://github.com/DeloitteDigitalUK/xLab/issues) the biggest shock was the loss of serendipitous, casual conversation. After iterating through various methods to address this (more regular Zoom calls, scheduled frequent catchups, all day calls, etc) it became clear that this is primarily a [[workflow & tooling]] problem, not an [[attitude, cultural, or management]] issue. To that end we added **Tandem** to our toolkit; through considered UI and frictionless usability, this enables a quicker and more informal way to see what colleagues are doing and jump into voice rooms with them.

ðŸš€ Purely through using this tool - the right tool - we've increased collaboration, efficiency, wellbeing, and standard of work

ðŸš€ We also still use Zoom, Teams, Slack, etc - the right tool depends on the task at hand. It is incorrect to view e.g. Tandem as a replacement for Teams, even if superficially they seem similar.
