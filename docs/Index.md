## rationale & scope

### Rationale 
Test the hypothesis: can better documentation address some of the challenges that we've face with fully-distributed working?

### Scope
The handbook is narrow in scope and deep detail. abstracting for current work and projects this should contain sufficient information to answer a hypothetical new-joiner's question:

> # during my first week here, what do I need to know to be at the right place at the right time?


nothing more

## principles  & structure

-   editable by all
-   the **team's meta-knowledge** in one place
-   an informal, **structured**, **accurate** **snapshot** of **our [methodologies, workflows](How-we-(enable)-work), and current [meeting cadence](Meeting-Cadence)**
-   a **known, single-source** of a narrowly defined set of atemporal (i.e. not project-specific) how we operate
-   the [changelog and release notes](https://github.com/DeloitteDigitalUK/xLab/releases/) summarises changes in our [ways of working](How-we-(enable)-work) - i.e. everything we've learnt and struggled with working in a distributed manner, our iterative approach to overcoming them, and how that's informed our vision of the [future of work](https://deloittedigitaluk.github.io/xLab/)

### structure
- The Changelog highlights a snapshot of our current working cadence.
- Each change is linked to a [PR or Issue](https://github.com/DeloitteDigitalUK/xLab/issues) - this creates a traceable flow of issue / problem -> change implemented to address that problem e.g. [**Slack is not asynchronous**](https://github.com/DeloitteDigitalUK/xLab/issues/3)

## What this is not

-   a **knowledge-base for everything** we've done
-   information on anything beyond **core team admin**

## First steps
